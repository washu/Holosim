Holosim

This application will be comparable to SimulationCraft.
Its intent is to simulate a Scenario to gauge potential DPS/HPS of a given boss fight based on team layout and gear.

Goals
=====
Support some form of micro web interface for execution results. (Sinatra based)
Support a DSL to configure the team layout
Support a DSL for the boss encounter, so specific encounters can be modeled as well as generic 'boss'
Support a binary distribution of some kind so end users dont have a difficult time to execute the simulation


Contributing to Holosim

    Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn’t been implemented or the bug hasn’t been fixed yet
    Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn’t requested it and/or contributed it
    Fork the project
    Start a feature/bugfix branch
    Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
    Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don’t break it in a future version unintentionally.
    Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
